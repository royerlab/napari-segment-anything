----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.


## Dev-Installation

Setup dev environment:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate labeling

pip install requirements.txt
```

Now, you can run `napari`.


## Installation

You can install `napari-segment-anything` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-segment-anything
```

We recommend installing the latest development version because this package is being developed:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jookuma/napari-segment-anything.git
```

**IMPORTANT**: `napari` won't work if you don't have `pyqt5` or `pyside2` installed.

## Instructions

### Opening napari-segment-anything

This software is napari plugin, so once you have napari installed you can open it using the command line:

```bash
napari <your image path> -w napari-segment-anything 'Segment Anything'
```

I noticed that sometimes napari fails to load the plugin widget from the command line, go to step 2 from below to load it.

If you prefer the user interface you need to:

1) Drag and drop your image into napari to load it;
2) Go to the "Plugins" file menu in the upper right corner and select the "Segment Anything" plugin.
3) Follow the instructions below for usage.

**IMPORTANT**: If you get an error make sure you have `pyqt5` or `pyside2` installed.

### Usage

- Interactions are done on the "SAM points" and "SAM box" layers using the existing functionalities of napari. Only rectangle shapes trigger the network prediction.
- For points supervision, left clicks are positive cues (object) and right clicks are negative (background).
- Press the "Confirm Annot." button (or the "C" key) to propagate the current segmentation mask to the label image.
- Use the napari labels layer features to delete or edit already confirmed labels.
